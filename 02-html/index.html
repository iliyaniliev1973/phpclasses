<p> My story: So my story starts with trying to book a room for August...Susan was suppose to call me back to book my two week stay and I never heard from her...so I called the next day to book and someone very rudely on the phone said, after a 15 min wait, that she was busy and would call me back.</p>

<p> I like to: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Swim</li>
  <li>Bike</li>
  <li>Read</li>
  <li>Watching movies</li>
  <li>Travel</li>
</ul>

<p> In my free-time this is where I am: </p>
